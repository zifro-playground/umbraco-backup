    <h4 class="bold color-red">Collisions detected</h4>
    <div ng-if="operation==='restore'">
        <p>Some of the Deploy (uda) files that exist in your repository in ~/data/revision, and represent your project's schema items
            such as data types or document types, are colliding. This means that you have e.g. two files defining items with
            different unique identifiers (udi) but with colliding unique properties (e.g. alias).</p>
        <p>This can occur if two developers have created the same schema item, and both of them commit and merge/push these changes
            to the Git repository. For example, this can create two files, each trying to define content type "myContentType" but
            with a different unique identifier (udi).</p>
        <p>You will need to cleanup/remove one of the colliding files. The <em>technical details</em> below will provide you with
            more details on which files are causing issues. In addition, you can refer to the
            <a href="https://our.umbraco.org/documentation/Umbraco-Cloud/Troubleshooting/Structure-Error/#error-in-courier-files-containing-site-structure" 
            target="_blank">online documentation</a> for more help.</p>
    </div>
    <div ng-if="operation==='deploy'">
        <p>Some of the items you are deploying collide with existing items on the remote site. This means that you are e.g. deploying
            an item with a unique property (e.g. alias) that has been created on remote with that same property, and therefore
            already exists there, but with a different unique identifier (udi).</p>
        <p>This can occur if the same item is created manually on both source and target.</p>
        <p>You will need to fix the situation before deploying. The <em>technical details</em> below will provide you with
            more details on which items are causing issues. And then you will need fix the unique identifiers in the database.</p>
